# SocketChat

Simple Node.js/Socket.io project for the course Gedistribueerde toepassingen of the study Applied engineering: computer science at Ghent University.
The application shows a real time overview of the online users, makes it possible to change names and to start chat in private with other users. It's was a purely eductional exercise, so I don't paid a lot of attention to scalability and stability in a production environment.
